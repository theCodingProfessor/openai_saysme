# openai_saysme
General GUI for OpenAI using Flask and Python

This is a Python/Flask interface to tinker with the OpenAI Chat and Response Modules
The requirements.txt file indicates what libraries are needed to run this in your own dev environment.
By the way this is not live for production, but is just a sandbox app. 

To run any of these functions, your will need your own OpenAI key. 
I have left a openai.api_key = "your key goes here" as a placeholder, you can get a free one at openai.com (register as developer)

Although this little app is not much to look at, it has the three basic flavors of resonses from the openai chat bot wired up.

I haven't asked openai if they mind that I am showing their api, I hope they will be allright with it.
